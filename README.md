## Additional Files needed

To interact with Google OAuth 2.0, a credentials file is needed from Google Cloud Platform.

Go to 'APIs & Services' and then to 'Credentials'. Then download the JSON file from the 'OAuth 2.0 Client IDs' and save within the java resources folder as 'client_secret.json'

If there is no credential created yet for OAuth 2.0 Client IDs, you can create one from the 'Create Credentials' button.
